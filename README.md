## github working process

1. create a branch
2. write your code in the branch and do commits
    * "fix: xxxxx" used for fix bug
    * "update: xxxxx" used for update new function 
    * "format: xxxxx" used for code formation or refractoring
    * "config: xxxxx" used for change or upload config file
   
   Generally, this 4 category is enough but exceptions are ok. And most of the case you are using **update** and **format**
3. Create a pull request on github and ask one of the team mate to
do code review. 
4. merge into main branch if good. 

- Please periodically pull from main branch.
- Please write comments / docstrings.
- Please do some test before commiting and especially doing pull requests.
